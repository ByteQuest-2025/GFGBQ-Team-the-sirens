✅ Project Overview

The National Grievance Portal is a full-stack MERN-based web application integrated with Google Gemini AI. It enables citizens to submit grievances that are automatically analyzed by AI to determine urgency and category.

A secure Admin Dashboard allows government officials to monitor, analyze, and manage grievances in real time, ensuring faster resolution and improved transparency.

Grievance Status Tracking
Citizens can track the complete lifecycle of their grievance using a unique MongoDB ObjectID.

Fail-Safe Demo Mode
Built-in offline data handling ensures the UI remains functional during network disruptions or demo conditions.
